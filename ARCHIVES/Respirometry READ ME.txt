All of our initial models suggested that nitrogen species (nitrate or ammonium) really did not have any impact so we are going to be greating ammonium and nitrate as two different datasets. We will be using the same controls for each of them since the experiment was done concurrently. Further, there are so many differences between E. coli and no E. coli that we will also treat these as different datasets in some of the analyses.
